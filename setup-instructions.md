# ðŸš€ Wish Wall Setup Instructions

## Problem: "Failed to fetch" Error

The error you're seeing is because the Appwrite environment variables aren't configured yet.

## Quick Fix:

### Step 1: Create Environment File
Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root directory with this content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_NAME=Wish Wall
```

### Step 2: Get Your Project ID
1. Go to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project (or create a new one)
4. Copy the Project ID from the dashboard
5. Replace `your_project_id_here` in the `.env.local` file

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

## Debugging:

If you still see errors, check the browser console for debug information. The app will now log:
- Your Appwrite configuration
- Detailed error messages
- Error codes and types

## Alternative: Quick Test

If you want to test without setting up Appwrite immediately, you can temporarily comment out the database calls in `src/app/page.js` to see the UI working.

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps?
